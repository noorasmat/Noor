### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Noor!

I'm a passionate **Machine Learning Engineer** with a focus on **Generative AI for NLP and Imaging**. My experience in NLP spans various domains, from **Large Language Models (LLM), NLP, transformers, and Sentiment Analysis to building Transformer-based chatbots. In computer vision I have experience of Effective Feature learning through Autoencoders, synthetic data generation Using GAN, and image segmentation using the Unet model, leveraging both spectral-spatial features.**

#### ðŸ”¬ Current Projects:
- **Transformer-based chatbot for health care**: Developing Health care chatbot using a pre-trained transformer with LangChain.
- **Generative AI**: Creating synthetic datasets to enhance model training.
- **Land Cover Scene Classification**: Leveraging CNNs for accurate image segmentation.

#### ðŸŽ“ Background:
- **PhD Candidate** specializing in advanced machine learning concepts.
- Completed projects on **Sentiment Analysis** (using Amazon reviews data) and **Transformer-based chatbots** for customer service.

#### ðŸ’» Tech Stack:
- **Languages**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Sklearn
- **Tools**: Jupyter, Git, 
- **Frameworks**: Transformers, CNNs, GANs, Stable Diffusion, AUtoencoder

#### ðŸŒ± Always Learning:
- Exploring the latest in **few-shot learning** and **data augmentation techniques**.
- Connecting with like-minded professionals in AI and machine learning.
